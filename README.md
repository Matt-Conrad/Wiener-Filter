# Wiener Filter Implementation
This repository is meant to house the implementation of "Interstitial fluid glucose time-lag correction for real-time continuous glucose monitoring" by Keenan et al.

## Inspiration
The reason for this project is to consolidate various aspects of my career into a single project. While this was attempted with my CXR Classification project [here](https://github.com/Matt-Conrad/CXR_View_Classification), the purpose of that project was to combine any technology of interest into one project, which contained some image processing and classification at its core. While that project was successful, this project is more focused on signal processing rather than languages, frameworks, or methodologies. 

This project's domain is in glucose monitoring in order for me to learn the physics and models behind glucose processes. These signals are similar to EMG signals that I worked with in robotic prostheses research and are in line with my schooling of Biomedical and Electrical Engineering that was centered around signal processing. The article this project is based on applies central signal processing concepts that allow me to practice signal processing theory and application, such as optimization, Fourier analysis, filter design, noise characterization, linear algebra, and more. The domain of glucose monitoring also has the benefit of simple 1D signals instead of higher dimensionality. The Wiener filter especially intrigued me because I recall it having some interesting properties from my first signal processing course so chose to do a deeper dive here. 

## Goals
The main goal of this project is to learn more glucose monitoring and to continue practicing signal processing. This will be achieved by implementing the research paper as closely as possible. This task can be difficult if there are any important details left out of the article. Secondary goals would be to improve upon the code and turn it into a REST API to deploy to the cloud and improve the security and quality to a professional level.
